# Crypto Exchange

Minimal skeleton project for a cryptocurrency exchange.

## Structure
- `backend/` – Node.js Express API with placeholder routes for spot, futures, and liquidity.
- `frontend/` – 2025-styled static web interface with panels for spot trading, futures, and liquidity provider tools.
- `mobile/ios/` – placeholder for iOS app.
- `mobile/android/` – placeholder for Android app.

Further development is required to implement full trading functionality, security, and compliance.
